# Welcome to Eclipse!

Welcome to the official Eclipse documentation! We're stoked to have you here. 
Here you'll find everything you need to get started with making on rollups with Eclipse, how they work and build dApps on top of them.

These docs are a work in progress, so if you have any questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5jDfXHJGCk).

### What is Eclipse?

Eclipse is a customizable rollup provider for developers building decentralized applications.

A customizable rollup is a lightweight blockchain that relies on some other blockchain (Layer 1) for security. A customizable rollup lets you pick which Layer 1 you use: whether that's Ethereum, Celestia, Polygon, Solana, or something else.

### How do we build on Eclipse?

There are 2 flavours of chains that can be spun up for building on Eclipse:
- EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains
- SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) chains

Depending on what sort of developer experience and features you're looking for, you can choose to build on either of these chains.
