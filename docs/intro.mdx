# Welcome to Eclipse!

This is the official Eclipse documentation! We're stoked to have you here. 
You'll find everything you need to get started with making on rollups with Eclipse, how they work and build dApps on top of them.

These docs are a work in progress, so if you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5jDfXHJGCk).

### What is Eclipse?

Eclipse is a customizable rollup provider for developers building decentralized applications.

A customizable rollup is a lightweight blockchain that relies on some other blockchain (Layer 1) for security. A customizable rollup lets you pick which Layer 1 you use: whether that's Ethereum, Celestia, Polygon, Solana, or something else.
