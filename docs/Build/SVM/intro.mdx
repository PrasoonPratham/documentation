# Deploying a "Hello World!" contract on an Eclipse SVM chain

Smart contracts can be deployed on Eclipse chains just like you would on Solana. This is because of Eclipse's compatibility with the SVM.

Here's a simple step-by-step tutorial on deploying a **"Hello World"** contract to an Eclipse chain.

:::note

This guide works right out of the box on Linux and macOS. 
If you're using Windows, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), we reccomend the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/wsl/wsl-introduction/introduction) for setting it up.

:::

## Prerequisites

### Acquiring testnet tokens

We need to [claim testnet tokens](../claim_testnet_tokens.mdx) to pay for transaction fees to deploy your smart contract to the testnet.

### Dependencies

**i.** Install Rust and it's package manager—Cargo. 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can check if the installation was successful by running the following commands:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

**ii.** We'll also have to install Node.js and npm using, which will be used later in this guide.

Visit the official **[Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** and download the installation binary for your system. Versions reccomend 14.0 and above.
npm is bundled with the Node.js installation, so you don't have to install it separately.

**iii.** Now let's install the Solana CLI, this allows you to interact with Solana clusters—our SVM chain on Eclipse in this case.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```


**iv.** Instead of setting your Solana CLI to a local cluster, set it to the SVM chain with the following command: 
```bash 
solana config set --url [TODO: Insert RPC URL]
```

**v.** If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:
```bash
solana-keygen new
```
