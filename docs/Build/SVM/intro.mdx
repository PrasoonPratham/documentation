# Deploying a "Hello World!" contract on an Eclipse SVM chain

Smart contracts can be deployed on Eclipse chains just like you would on Solana. This is because of Eclipse's compatibility with the SVM.

Here's a simple step-by-step tutorial on deploying a **"Hello World"** contract to an Eclipse chain.

:::info

This guide works right out of the box on Linux and macOS. 
If you're using Windows, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), we reccomend the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/wsl/wsl-introduction/introduction) for setting it up.

:::

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you'll have to do before you can deploy your smart contract to the SVM chain.

### Install dependencies

**i.** Install Rust and it's package manager—Cargo. 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can check if the installation was successful by running the following commands:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

**ii.** We'll also have to install Node.js and npm using, which will be used later in this guide.

Visit the official **[Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** and download the installation binary for your system. Versions reccomend 14.0 and above.

:::note

npm is bundled with the Node.js installation, so you don't have to install it separately.

:::

**iii.** Now let's install the Solana CLI, this allows you to interact with Solana clusters—our SVM chain on Eclipse in this case.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```
**iv.** Instead of setting your Solana CLI to a local cluster, set it to the SVM chain with the following command: 
```bash 
solana config set --url [TODO: Insert RPC URL]
```

**v.** If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:
```bash
solana-keygen new
```

This will generate a new keypair and save it to your local machine. You will need this keypair to sign transactions to deploy your smart contract to the SVM chain.

### Acquiring testnet tokens

We need to [claim testnet tokens](../claim_testnet_tokens.mdx) to pay for transaction fees to deploy your smart contract to the testnet. 

Proceed to the next step when you've acquired the test tokens.

:::warning

These testnet tokens are only valid on the testnet and are meant for testing purposes only. Eclipse will never charge you for testnet tokens, please be vary of scams. Report any suspicious activity to us on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5jDfXHJGCk).

:::

### Deploying the smart contract

Now that we've set up our environment, we can deploy our smart contract to the Eclipse SVM chain. 
Let's start by running a local Solana cluster.

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

:::note

Incase the validator fails to start, restart your computer and run the following command:

```bash 
sudo $(command -v solana-sys-tuner) --user $(whoami) > sys-tuner.log 2>&1 &
``` 

:::

Now we'll clone the Solana Hello World repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld
cd example-helloworld
npm install
```

Next we will build the smart contract.

```bash
npm run build:program-rust
```

Finally, we can deploy the smart contract to the SVM chain.

```bash
solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so
```

We can run the JavaScript client and confirm whether the smart contract was deployed successfully.

```bash
npm run start
```

The output should be something like this.

```
Let's say hello to a Solana account...
Connection to cluster established: http://127.0.0.1:8899 { 'feature-set': 2045430982, 'solana-core': '1.7.8' }

8MBmHtJvxpKdYhdw6yPpedp6X6y2U9dCpdYaZJdmwV3A has been greeted 1 times
Success
```
:::note

Not seeing the expected output? 
- Make sure you've run all the commands in the previous steps.
- Inspect the program logs by running `solana logs` to see why the program failed.
