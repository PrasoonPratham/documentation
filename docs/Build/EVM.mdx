# Documentation for Eclipse with EVM (Ethereum)

### Introduction to EVM Deployment

If you're brand new to Eclipse, we recommend checking out any other EVM chain's "Hello World" tutorial. For example, you can try out Optimism's guide to deploying a basic contract. The only things that you'll change are the following:

- [Claim Testnet Tokens](claim-testnet-tokens.mdx) 
- Wherever it says "Optimism Goerli URL", instead use the following URL: [RPC URL]
- Wherever it says "block explorer URL", use the following URL: [block explorer URL]

This Eclipse chain is EVM-compatible, so more than likely the process will be as simple as deploying a contract to Ethereum.

### Integration Instructions
Do you need additional assistance integrating something special like a wallet, bridge, something else? Feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5jDfXHJGCk).
