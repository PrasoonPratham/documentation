# Documentation for Eclipse with SVM (Solana)

This guide explains everything you need to know to use an Eclipse SVM chain.

### Introduction to SVM Deployment

If you're brand new to Eclipse, we recommend checking out Solana's ["Hello world"](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld) tutorial.
The only things that you'll change are the following:
- [Claim Testnet Tokens](/claim_testnet_tokens.mdx) 
- Instead of setting your Solana CLI to a local cluster, set it to the SVM chain with the following command: `solana config set --url [TODO: Insert RPC URL]`
- For a block explorer, use the following URL: [block explorer URL]

This Eclipse chain is SVM-compatible, so more than likely the process will be as simple as deploying a contract to Solana.
